# Learn PyGame Toy Project

Based on [Vlad's repo](https://github.com/halloweex/learn-pygame).

More info and comments in the future, if I have time. Some parts are done nicely. Some are done quickly. It's just a toy project.

I'm not sure where Vlad got all of his assets, so if you know where these assets came from, please tell me so I can attribute properly.

On *nix
```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
